#PoSRIC
The **Po**rtable **S**cripted **R**iPorFS **I**nterface in **C**89

##What is PoSRIC?

PoSRIC is a program that interfaces with RiPorFS using commands. It strives to
(one day) provide a portable and powerful interface to RiPorFS archives that
both beginners and DOS dwellers can use.

##What are the current features?

 * Basic stdio command interpretation
 * Basic archive handling

##Where can I find more info?

README.PDF is the manual for PoSRIC where most of the documentation is written.
It needs vast improvements but currently it's all I'm willing to put out.

##How can I improve the source?

 * Add/fix comments
 * Improve documentation
 * Translate documentation
 * Improve the code
 * Suggest features
 * Add code

Contributors will be placed in AUTHORS.TXT and listed in the splash of PoSRIC

##Misc

 * PoSRIC has been tested on Debian and DOSBOX
 * PoSRIC currently doesn't work on DOSBOX
